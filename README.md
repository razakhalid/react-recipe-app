## React practice project

This project was sitting on my computer for the longest time. Just before totally forgetting I built this, I decided to put it up on Github.

It's a basic React app to create and edit recipes, it's lacking in styling because the focus was to dynamically render the DOM
as the user selects an existing recipe and makes changes to it.

## To run the app:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
